# Toolbar Dial

Toolbar Dial replaces the New Tab page and requires no configuration. Bookmarks and folders in the "Bookmarks bar" folder will be shown in a grid that is similar to the Speed Dial in the Opera web browser.

## No Configuration Required

Toolbar Dial is ready to go with no configuration required! Place bookmarks and folders that you would like to be shown in the Toolbar Dial grid in the "Bookmarks bar" folder. They will be shown in the same order they are in the folder. To change the order of bookmarks or folders in the Toolbar Dial grid, rearrange their order in the "Bookmarks bar" folder.

## Customization Options

The Toolbar Dial Options page offers a Dark mode that complements the browser's dark theme. It also offers the ability to change the default folder, if you'd prefer to use something other the "Bookmarks bar" folder.
