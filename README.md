# Toolbar Dial

Toolbar Dial replaces the New Tab page and requires no configuration. Bookmarks in the "Bookmarks bar" folder will be shown in a grid that is similar to the Speed Dial in Opera browser.

## No Configuration

Place bookmarks that you would like to be shown in the Toolbar Dial grid in the "Bookmarks bar" folder. Bookmarks in the "Bookmarks bar" folder will be show in the same order they are in the folder. To change the order of bookmarks in the Toolbar Dial grid, rearrange the order of bookmarks in the "Bookmarks bar" folder.

At this time nested folders in the "Bookmarks bar" folder won't be displayed in the Toolbar Dial grid.
