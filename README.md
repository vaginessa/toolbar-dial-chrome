# Toolbar Dial

Toolbar Dial replaces the New Tab page and requires no configuration. Bookmarks and folders in the "Bookmarks bar" folder will be shown in a grid that is similar to the Speed Dial in Opera browser.

## No Configuration

Place bookmarks and folders that you would like to be shown in the Toolbar Dial grid in the "Bookmarks bar" folder. They will be show in the same order they are in the folder. To change the order of bookmarks or folders in the Toolbar Dial grid, rearrange their order in the "Bookmarks bar" folder.

A dark theme is available in Options.
